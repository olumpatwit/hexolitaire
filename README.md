# Hexolitaire

Hexolitaire is a single-player card game designed to challenge and entertain players as they strive to achieve the highest score possible. Drawing inspiration from classic solitaire games, Hexolitaire adds a unique twist by incorporating cards numbered from 0 to 16, each displayed in three numerical formats: decimal, binary, and hexadecimal.
